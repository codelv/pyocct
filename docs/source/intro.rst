About
=====
The **pyOCCT** project provides Python bindings to the OpenCASCADE geometry kernel via pybind11.
Together, this technology stack enables rapid CAD/CAE/CAM application development in the popular
Python programming language.

## Enabling technology
The pyOCCT core technology stack includes:

* `OpenCASCADE <https://www.opencascade.com>`_: Open CASCADE Technology (OCCT) is an object-oriented
  C++ class library designed for rapid production of sophisticated domain-specific CAD/CAM/CAE
  applications.

* `pybind11 <https://github.com/pybind/pybind11>`_: A lightweight header-only library that exposes
  C++ types in Python and vice versa, mainly to create Python bindings of existing C++ code.
